3.txt -> the rows represent the class numbers(1 to 13)
	the columns represent the true positives obtained for different thresholds of information retention . x varies as 29+i*5, i=0:14 .
4.txt -> the rows represent the class numbers(1 to 13)
	the columns represent the false positives obtained for different thresholds of information retention . x varies as 29+i*5, i=0:14 .
for 3 and 4, we have gone to every class and trained 6 samples of each class at a time and tested 1 sample of each class. so we have only 1 image with class 1 and rest 12 are labelled as 0. this is repeated7 times, leaving one sample everytime. therefore for one class number of positives =7 and negatives = 7*12 =84 as there are 13 classes.
